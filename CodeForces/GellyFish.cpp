/*
Gellyfish hates math problems, but she has to finish her math homework:
Gellyfish is given an array of n positive integers
Select two indexes i, j satisfying 1≤i,j≤n and i≠j

Replace ai with gcd(ai,aj)

Now, Gellyfish asks you for the minimum number of operations to achieve her goal.

It can be proven that Gellyfish can always achieve her goal.
